# Memory card game

This memory card game uses country api: https://restcountries.eu/ and flag api: https://www.countryflags.io/

The game shows cards for five seconds, then covers them with UN flag. You can choose how many pairs of cards by selecting from select menu.

# Motivation 

Wanted to do something cool with these two apis.

# How it works?

Basically country api have information about every nation in the world. Sadly I just used for only one thing: getting flags by country code.

# Something that I may add in future

Better UI/UX

More options
