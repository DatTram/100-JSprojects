# 100-JSprojects
Building 100 different projects to become a proficient JS programmer.

# Rules

1. Self-paced, so no deadline.

~~Only vanilla JS with HTML and CSS (CSS frameworks and preprocessors are allowed). ~~
(edit: 19.1.2021)
2. JS frameworks is allowed, because it will be a great learning experience and remastering old projects in a framework would be awesome.


3. APIs are allowed.
