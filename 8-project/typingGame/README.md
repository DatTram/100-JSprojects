# Typing Game

Calculates your WPM. 

Press "Escape" to reset.

# Motivation 

I have always wanted to do a typing game.

# To be implemented

Add UI (won't be responsible for mobile) 

Multiplayer (but it will be taking some time)

ps: right now so many of my older projects need revamping, so few more projects then focusing on older stuff.

# Used APIs
